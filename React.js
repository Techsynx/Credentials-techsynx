🚀 **Next.js vs React.js: Which One Should You Choose?** 🤔

As developers, we all face the age-old question: **Next.js** or **React.js**? While both are incredible tools built around JavaScript, they cater to different needs:

🔹 **React.js** is a flexible library focused on building user interfaces. It’s great for creating Single Page Applications (SPAs) but often needs extra libraries for routing, SSR, and more.

🔹 **Next.js** is a powerful framework built on top of React, offering **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**, **Static Site Generation (SSG)**, and built-in **file-based routing**, making it perfect for performance optimization and SEO-driven projects.

Here’s a quick breakdown:

✨ **React.js Pros**:
- More control over the tech stack.
- Great for highly customized projects.
- Huge ecosystem of libraries and tools.

⚡ **Next.js Pros**:
- SEO-friendly out of the box with SSR & SSG.
- Built-in API routes for full-stack development.
- Optimized performance with automatic code splitting.

So which one should you pick? 🤷‍♂️

💡 Use **React.js** when you need flexibility and plan to integrate your own tools.

💡 Choose **Next.js** when you want to speed up development with built-in features and need better performance + SEO.
